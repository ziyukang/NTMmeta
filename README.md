doing meta analysis on NTM disease prevalence  and NTM strain isolation rate in China
In 2025, we decided to perform a meta analysis on NTM study in China, focusing on NTM disease prevalence and NTM strain isolation rate, both individually and combindedly. after screening the literature for both 3 Chinese publication databases and Pubmed, we got 85 publications published from 2016 - 2025, studying NTM epidemology wthin China.
We performed meta analysis employing random-effect model to estimate overall NTM disease prevalence, NTM isolation rate. We also studied geographycal variation using subgroup analysis. All analyses were performed with R packages meta and metafor.
